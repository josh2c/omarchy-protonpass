# Engineer brief: extend the security residue scan to the state directory

You are the ENGINEER for this task. Do the work directly in this session; do
not dispatch, do not ask the coordinator to run anything. You are working on
Josh's own machine, which is also his live desktop, so the environment rules
below are not optional.

## The project

`omarchy-protonpass` is a Proton Pass bar-widget plugin for Omarchy Quattro
(Hyprland + quickshell). Repo: `~/projects/omarchy-protonpass`, `main` =
`origin/main` = release 1.5.0 (e529a3e). GitHub: josh2c/omarchy-protonpass.
Runtime is four files: `omarchy-protonpass` (bash helper, the only component
that touches secrets, wraps the official `pass-cli`), `Service.qml` (state
machine, one Process per helper command), `Panel.qml` (UI and the single key
handler), `Keybinds.js`. Tests in `tests/`: offline bash suites
(`manifest-test.sh`, `helper-test.sh`, `security-test.sh`,
`source-contract-test.sh`, `budget-test.sh` which takes about 90 s) and QML
harnesses (`qml-*.sh`) that need a nested compositor. Mocks under
`tests/mocks/` (`pass-cli`, `hostile-pass-cli`, `wl-copy`, `wl-paste`);
`MOCK_SCENARIO` selects behaviour. Read `SECURITY.md` and `README.md` first;
they are the promises this change must keep.

Decision record and tools live on the orphan branch `dev-docs`:
`git show dev-docs:PLAN.md` (§1.3 defers a disk index, §3.7 says metadata is
never at rest), `git show dev-docs:PR-PROCESS.md`, and `tools/` (check out
with `git worktree add <dir> dev-docs`): `envelope-matrix.sh` diffs every
helper command × scenario before and after a change; `stress.sh` hunts hangs.

## Binding rules

- Secrets never enter QML, argv, the environment, files, or logs. Item
  metadata stays in memory only. No new files on disk, no new settings, no
  new environment variables.
- Leave-alone list: `_validatedResponse`, the index generation fencing,
  `unset` discipline, `printf x` capture, the `/dev/fd` template path, TOCTOU
  double reads, rejection sampling, mode and symlink checks, the dynamic
  security suite, and the CI seeded-mutation gates. If your change needs to
  touch one, stop and say so in the report instead of changing it.
- Redundant hygiene in the helper is mechanism, not clutter. Do not "clean up".
- Commit messages: imperative title, plain prose body saying what changed and
  why. No tool attributions, no `Co-Authored-By`, no session links, anywhere.
  Check with `git log origin/main..HEAD --format=%B | grep -iE 'claude|co-authored|session'`
  before pushing; it must print nothing. Commit as
  `git -c user.name="Josh Garcia" -c user.email="garciajosh313@gmail.com"`.
- No version pins in tests (shape checks only).

## Machine and environment

- Work in a scratch worktree, never in `~/projects/omarchy-protonpass` itself:
  `git -C ~/projects/omarchy-protonpass worktree add /tmp/<lane>-wt <ref>`.
  Remove it (`git worktree remove`) when done.
- Josh's live install is `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/josh2c.protonpass`, a
  clone whose origin is the local repo. Do not modify it. Hot reload serves
  stale QML; a live check needs `omarchy plugin update josh2c.protonpass --yes`
  followed by a full shell restart, and only do a live check if the brief's
  acceptance requires it (it does, once, at the end). The shipped
  `omarchy-restart-shell` can report success with no shell running. Use:
  `while timeout 5 quickshell kill -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell --any-display >/dev/null 2>&1; do :; done; sleep 1; hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.exec_cmd("omarchy-launch-shell")'`
  then check `journalctl --user -n 200 | grep -i 'widget failed'` is empty.
  Because the live install's origin is the local repo, the live check needs
  the branch merged into a local throwaway ref the install can pull; simplest
  is to point the install's checkout at your branch with
  `git -C ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/josh2c.protonpass fetch /tmp/<lane>-wt <ref> && git -C ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/josh2c.protonpass checkout FETCH_HEAD`,
  restart the shell, verify, then `checkout main` and restart again so Josh's
  desktop is left as you found it. Say in the report that you restored it.
- The QML harnesses are layer-shell surfaces that grab exclusive keyboard
  focus. Never run them on the host Wayland session: they steal Josh's
  keyboard while he types. `tests/lib-nested-display.sh` starts a nested
  Hyprland and detects its display through the lock file the compositor holds
  open; it refuses if the detected display equals `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. Use the
  `tests/qml-*.sh` wrappers, which go through it. After every harness run
  check for leaks: `pgrep -a Hyprland` (only the host one), `pgrep -af
  silent-helper` (nothing), `ls /run/user/1000 | grep wayland-` (only the host
  socket). Kill anything left.
- `pass-cli` 2.3.2 is installed at `~/.local/bin/pass-cli`. You do not need a
  Proton account; every suite runs on mocks. Do not run `pass-cli login`.
- `mise` shims can shadow `/usr/bin`; if a tool behaves oddly, prefix
  `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH`.
- Baselines under `tests/baselines/` are comparison tools, not CI members;
  when your change intentionally alters the snapshot, regenerate and commit
  the baseline and say what moved.

## Task

`tests/security-test.sh` plants a marker secret, runs a real copy, and scans
process arguments, the helper's environment, and every file the run touched
for the marker. The file scan covers `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (around :139-143) but
not `XDG_STATE_HOME`, where the helper keeps `recents.json`. Any future
change that writes vault-derived data under the state dir would pass the
suite unnoticed; PR 3 on GitHub would have. Branch `residue-scan` from
`origin/main`.

1. Extend the residue contract to the sandbox's state directory: after the
   copy, create, and recents paths run, no file under it may contain the
   marker, an item title, a vault name, or a username from the mock data.
   Keep the existing assertion that `recents.json` holds only id and
   timestamp keys.
2. Mutation-test it: temporarily make the helper write a title into the
   state dir, the suite must go red; revert.
3. Confirm the CI seeded-mutation step for the security suite still rejects
   its seeded violation.

This suite is on the leave-alone list as a security gate: you may add
assertions, never weaken or remove one. Acceptance: offline suites, budget
suite, ShellCheck green; envelope matrix unchanged. Push the branch, open a
PR, report the run ID.

## Reporting

Emit the implementation table (feature / part name · % complete · LOE ·
% certainty · questions to nail down human-AI intent before implementation)
with the questions column filled before you start, at every stop point, and
in the final report. If a verification result flips between runs, stop on
the second flip and report what you know versus what you claimed. The final
report lists the branch, every run ID with its conclusion, and the leak
checks.
