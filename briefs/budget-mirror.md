# Engineer brief: tie the QML budget mirror to the helper

You are the ENGINEER for this task. Do the work directly in this session; do
not dispatch, do not ask the coordinator to run anything. You are working on
Josh's own machine, which is also his live desktop, so the environment rules
below are not optional.

## The project

`omarchy-protonpass` is a Proton Pass bar-widget plugin for Omarchy Quattro
(Hyprland + quickshell). Repo: `~/projects/omarchy-protonpass`, `main` =
`origin/main` = release 1.5.0 (e529a3e). GitHub: josh2c/omarchy-protonpass.
Runtime is four files: `omarchy-protonpass` (bash helper, the only component
that touches secrets, wraps the official `pass-cli`), `Service.qml` (state
machine, one Process per helper command), `Panel.qml` (UI and the single key
handler), `Keybinds.js`. Tests in `tests/`: offline bash suites
(`manifest-test.sh`, `helper-test.sh`, `security-test.sh`,
`source-contract-test.sh`, `budget-test.sh` which takes about 90 s) and QML
harnesses (`qml-*.sh`) that need a nested compositor. Mocks under
`tests/mocks/` (`pass-cli`, `hostile-pass-cli`, `wl-copy`, `wl-paste`);
`MOCK_SCENARIO` selects behaviour. Read `SECURITY.md` and `README.md` first;
they are the promises this change must keep.

Decision record and tools live on the orphan branch `dev-docs`:
`git show dev-docs:PLAN.md` (§1.3 defers a disk index, §3.7 says metadata is
never at rest), `git show dev-docs:PR-PROCESS.md`, and `tools/` (check out
with `git worktree add <dir> dev-docs`): `envelope-matrix.sh` diffs every
helper command × scenario before and after a change; `stress.sh` hunts hangs.

## Binding rules

- Secrets never enter QML, argv, the environment, files, or logs. Item
  metadata stays in memory only. No new files on disk, no new settings, no
  new environment variables.
- Leave-alone list: `_validatedResponse`, the index generation fencing,
  `unset` discipline, `printf x` capture, the `/dev/fd` template path, TOCTOU
  double reads, rejection sampling, mode and symlink checks, the dynamic
  security suite, and the CI seeded-mutation gates. If your change needs to
  touch one, stop and say so in the report instead of changing it.
- Redundant hygiene in the helper is mechanism, not clutter. Do not "clean up".
- Commit messages: imperative title, plain prose body saying what changed and
  why. No tool attributions, no `Co-Authored-By`, no session links, anywhere.
  Check with `git log origin/main..HEAD --format=%B | grep -iE 'claude|co-authored|session'`
  before pushing; it must print nothing. Commit as
  `git -c user.name="Josh Garcia" -c user.email="garciajosh313@gmail.com"`.
- No version pins in tests (shape checks only).

## Machine and environment

- Work in a scratch worktree, never in `~/projects/omarchy-protonpass` itself:
  `git -C ~/projects/omarchy-protonpass worktree add /tmp/<lane>-wt <ref>`.
  Remove it (`git worktree remove`) when done.
- Josh's live install is `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/josh2c.protonpass`, a
  clone whose origin is the local repo. Do not modify it. Hot reload serves
  stale QML; a live check needs `omarchy plugin update josh2c.protonpass --yes`
  followed by a full shell restart, and only do a live check if the brief's
  acceptance requires it (it does, once, at the end). The shipped
  `omarchy-restart-shell` can report success with no shell running. Use:
  `while timeout 5 quickshell kill -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell --any-display >/dev/null 2>&1; do :; done; sleep 1; hyprctl dispatch 'hl.dsp.exec_cmd("omarchy-launch-shell")'`
  then check `journalctl --user -n 200 | grep -i 'widget failed'` is empty.
  Because the live install's origin is the local repo, the live check needs
  the branch merged into a local throwaway ref the install can pull; simplest
  is to point the install's checkout at your branch with
  `git -C ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/josh2c.protonpass fetch /tmp/<lane>-wt <ref> && git -C ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/josh2c.protonpass checkout FETCH_HEAD`,
  restart the shell, verify, then `checkout main` and restart again so Josh's
  desktop is left as you found it. Say in the report that you restored it.
- The QML harnesses are layer-shell surfaces that grab exclusive keyboard
  focus. Never run them on the host Wayland session: they steal Josh's
  keyboard while he types. `tests/lib-nested-display.sh` starts a nested
  Hyprland and detects its display through the lock file the compositor holds
  open; it refuses if the detected display equals `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. Use the
  `tests/qml-*.sh` wrappers, which go through it. After every harness run
  check for leaks: `pgrep -a Hyprland` (only the host one), `pgrep -af
  silent-helper` (nothing), `ls /run/user/1000 | grep wayland-` (only the host
  socket). Kill anything left.
- `pass-cli` 2.3.2 is installed at `~/.local/bin/pass-cli`. You do not need a
  Proton account; every suite runs on mocks. Do not run `pass-cli login`.
- `mise` shims can shadow `/usr/bin`; if a tool behaves oddly, prefix
  `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH`.
- Baselines under `tests/baselines/` are comparison tools, not CI members;
  when your change intentionally alters the snapshot, regenerate and commit
  the baseline and say what moved.

## Task

`Service.qml` (around :33-34) hard-codes `maxIndexItems` and `maxIndexVaults`
to mirror the helper's `INDEX_MAX_ITEMS_TOTAL` and `INDEX_MAX_VAULTS`
(`omarchy-protonpass` around :24-28). Nothing ties them. Raise the helper
limit within what `tests/budget-test.sh` permits and `_validatedResponse`
rejects a valid envelope; the panel then shows a generic error. Branch
`budget-mirror` from `origin/main`.

Decide between two shapes and justify the choice in the commit body: (a) the
helper emits its limits in the index envelope and the service validates
against those, with a hard-coded outer ceiling in the service so a hostile
envelope cannot raise them (the ceiling must equal the fixed ceiling in
`tests/budget-test.sh`); or (b) keep both constants and add one offline test
that parses both files and fails when they differ. (b) is smaller; (a) is
more honest. Either way, mutation-test the result: change one side, the gate
must go red. `_validatedResponse` is on the leave-alone list; if (a) needs
to touch it, describe the exact change in your table's questions column and
stop for a decision before coding.

Acceptance: offline suites, budget suite, both CI seeded-mutation gates,
ShellCheck green; envelope matrix unchanged unless (a) adds fields, in which
case only the new fields move; no QML harness needed unless Service.qml
behaviour changes for valid input, in which case run service scenarios in the
nested compositor. Push the branch, open a PR, report the run ID.

## Reporting

Emit the implementation table (feature / part name · % complete · LOE ·
% certainty · questions to nail down human-AI intent before implementation)
with the questions column filled before you start, at every stop point, and
in the final report. If a verification result flips between runs, stop on
the second flip and report what you know versus what you claimed. The final
report lists the branch, every run ID with its conclusion, and the leak
checks.
